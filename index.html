        Luna the otter pup, formerly know as Pup 681, was
        abandoned by her mother and found all alone at a
        California beach in early November 2014. She is now exploring the
        habitat in her new home, the Shedd Aquarium.

        Luna has already mastered swimming on her tummy
        and back, according to the aquarium, and can
        dive. She can now use her flipper to play and
        propel her around the special 1,249-gallon private
        nursery pool she calls home. She's so adorable!!
